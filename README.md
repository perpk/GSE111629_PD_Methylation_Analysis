# GSE111629 Methylation Analysis for Parkinson's Disease
A collection of workbooks and scripts to establish a properly working pipeline to analyse Methylation data based on the [GSE111629](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE111629) dataset.

Recommendations from [AccuraScience](https://www2.accurascience.com/blogs_32_0.html) were acknowledged and implemented accordingly for Illumina 450k Methylation Array
- The referenced blog article was co-authored by Zack Tu, Ph.D., Lead Bioinformatician and Justin T. Li, Ph.D., Lead Bioinformatician.
